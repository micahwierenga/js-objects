# JavaScript Objects

<!--11:25 5 minutes -->

[Hook]: # (-Code this out- So we've seen arrays, and how they can be a very helpful method to store data. So my program always needs access to this fourth element in the array. How do I get that? Great. However, what happens if I remove an item from the middle of my array? -Indices shift- Now how do I get that same element? Also, if we hire a new developer tomorrow, and he takes a look at my code, how is he/she supposed to know what array[3] means? With key-value stores, we can solve both those issues.)

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- **Compare** key-value stores and arrays as data structures
- **Create** empty objects and objects with multiple properties using object literal syntax
- **Compare** adding and retrieving properties to an existing object using the dot and bracket notations
- **Access** the keys of a key-value store to return and manipulate values

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- **Create** and **manipulate** variables with JavaScript
- **Use** the chrome dev tools console

## Opening

### What are objects and key-value stores

There are two main ways to group data in modern languages:

|key value store | array |
|--------------- | ----- |
|Can store any data type, strings, numbers, arrays | Can store any data type, strings, numbers, arrays | 
|Access the values by key or name                  | Access the values by index |
|Set a value after it has been created             | Set a value after it had been created | 
|Dynamic can add a key at any time                 | Add values to the end of array easily |

[CFU]: # (Ask the students for properties of arrays as activity as we work through the chart)
[Comment]: # (This makes things much easier for humans. We can associate names with things rather than remembering that name is three memory offsets from something.) 

Some unique JavaScript issues:
* No separate key-value store, we use objects

[Comment]: # (We'll talk more about the extra properties of the Object type next week during some lectures on OOP.)

* The keys of JavaScript key-value stores are called properties.

[CFU]: # (Fo5 for key-value stores, properties.)

## Creating Objects

There are 2 main ways to create an object in Javascript.

#### Object literal syntax

This is also called an [object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer).

```javascript
var myObject = {};
```

#### Constructor function

It is also possible to use a `function` statement to create an object that serves as a "constructor function."

The first step is to write a function that will define the object. By convention, we start the name of a constructor function with a capital letter. Once the function is defined (in the current scope), you can create a new object by using the keyword `new`.

```javascript
function Classroom(name, numberOfStudents) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numberOfStudents = numberOfStudents;
}

var boojCoding = new Classroom("booj-coding", 2);
```

<!--11:45 10 minutes -->

## Object Properties

Objects in JavaScript **always** have properties associated with them.

You can think of a property on a JavaScript object as a type of variable that contains a value. The properties of an object can be accessed using "dot notation":

```javascript
var Person = {
  name: "Ben"
}

Person.name
=> "Ben"
```

You can define or re-assign a property by assigning it a value using `=` as you would a normal variable.

```javascript

Person.name = "Alex"

Person.name
=> "Alex"
```

### Excercise 
Create an object called ``classroom`` with properties, company and city. The company property should have value "booj" and the city property should have value "Denver".
<details>
  ```javascript
  var classroom = {
    company: "booj",
    city: "Denver"
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Bracket notation

There is another way to set properties on a JavaScript object.

```javascript
classroom["company"] = "booj";
classroom["city"] = "Denver";
```

This syntax can also be used to read properties of an object:

```javascript
console.log(classroom["company"]);
=> "booj";

var property = "city";

console.log(classroom["property"]);
=> "Denver";
```

For more details see [MDN's Documentation on Property Accessors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors).


#### Deleting properties

If you want to delete a property of an object (and by extension, the value attached to the property), you need to use the [`delete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) operator:

The following code shows how to remove a property:

```
var classroom = {
  "company": "booj", 
  "city": "Denver", 
  "start": "12/12/2018"
};
delete classroom.start;
classroom
=> {company: "booj", city: "Denver"}
```

<!--11:55 5 minutes -->

## Object methods

As we've said before, the value of a property can be anything in JavaScript, which includes functions. When a function is attached to a property, this function becomes a `method`. Methods are defined the exact same way as a function, except that they have to be defined as the property of an object.

```javascript
var classroom = {
  name: "booj coding",
  city: "Denver",
  start: "12/12/2018",
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};
```

To call the method, we add a pair of parentheses to execute it:

```
classroom.sayHello();
=> Hello
```

## `this` for object references

In JavaScript, `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object.


```
var classroom = {
  name: "booj coding",
  city: "Denver",
  start: "12/12/2018",
  classInfo: function(){
    console.log("This is " + this.name + " and the class starts on " + this.start);
  }
};

classroom.classInfo()
=> This is booj coding and it starts on 12/12/2018
```

#### Assigning a previously-defined function

We can attach regular functions to objects as methods, even after they are created.

```
var sayHello = function() { 
  console.log("Hello");
}

classroom.sayHello = sayHello;

classroom.sayHello()
=> Hello
```
<!-- 12:00 5 minutes -->

## Enumerating properties of an object

We can use ``Object.keys()`` function to get all of the keys of an object.

Once we have an array of the keys we can loop over the keys to work with all of the properties of an object.

```javascript
var myCar = {
  "make": "Ford", 
  "model": "Mustang", 
  "year": 1969
};

var keys = Object.keys(myCar)

for(var i = 0; i < keys.length; i++){ 
  console.log("Key " + i + " " + keys[i]) ;
}
```

This section from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Creating_new_objects#Objects_and_properties) has more details.

[Comment]: # (There are some corner cases that apply to enumeration based on the fact that its an object but we'll get into those next week.)

<!--12:05 5 minutes -->

## Comparing Objects

In JavaScript, if two objects are created separately, they are distinct, even if they are given the same properties.

```javascript
var student1 = {
  name: "Chris"
};
=> undefined

var student2 = {
  name: "Chris"
};
=> undefined

student1 == student2
=> false

student1['name'] === student2['name']
=> true
```

Moreover, objects are assigned by reference. Another way to say this is if we create a new variable and assign the 
object to the new variable we don't create a new object.

```javascript
var student1 = {
  name: "Chris"
};
=> undefined

var student2 = student1;
=> undefined

student2.name
=> "Chris"

student2.name = "Tom";
=> "Tom"

student1.name
=> "Tom"

student1 === student2
=> true
```

[CFU]: # (Stop and jot on the solutions to student1.name and the equality)

What? Why is that?  Well, even though we had two names we only had a single object. Both of these variables are pointing to the same thing.

<!--12:10 18 minutes -->

## Monkey Exercise

- Create a `monkey` object, which has the following properties:

  - `name`
  - `species`
  - `favoriteFoods`

  And the following methods:

  - `eatSomething(food)`: tells the user that `name` ate `food`
  - `introduce`: produces a string introducing the current monkey, including its name, species, and its favorite foods

- Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set. All monkeys should eat multiple foods.

- Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes for 
retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).

[CFU]: # (A new requirement has just come. We need to start keeping track of color. Add a color property to each monkey.)

<!--12:28 2 minutes -->

## Conclusion

We will use key-value stores in JavaScript every day, and you will have plenty of time to practice creating and using 
objects in Javascript. There are a lot of resources available on the web for you to dive deeper, but the most detailed 
and understandable one is probably MDN.
